The Saving Portal is an automated cashback monitoring system that automatically scans the best cashback rates of many platforms and displays those values both numerically and statistically.

How to set it up and use it:
---------------------------------------------------------------
First, check if you have git installed.

You can do this by entering `git --version` inside the terminal.

If you do not have git installed, there are plenty of sources online to help you get started.
Here is one of the sources to help you with getting git setup in your system.

Clone the Repository
---------------------------------------------------------------
Once you have git setup, enter this git command to clone the repository so that you can use it for your own use.

`git clone git@github.com:teateatime/TheSavingPortal.git`

Once successfully cloned, type in `cd TheSavingPortal` and then type in `python scraper.py` inside the terminal/cmd to use the program.

Afterwards it will output several lines afterwards and you can run the app on 
"http://127.0.0.1:5000". From there you will be introduced to the main page and view the cashback rates
of multiple stores at your leisure.
